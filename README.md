# Portfolio Website

This is a personal portfolio website built with React.js, bundled using Vite, and styled with Tailwind CSS. It utilizes React Router DOM for smooth navigation across various sections.

## Features

- **React.js**: Modular and efficient development using the power of React components.
- **Vite**: Fast bundling with lightning-fast hot module replacement (HMR).
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **React Router DOM**: Enables dynamic, client-side routing for seamless navigation between pages.
